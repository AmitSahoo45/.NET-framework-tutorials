1. What is the default passing mechanism for parameters in C#?
- Pass by Value - answer
- Pass by Reference
- Pass by Pointer
- Pass by Output

2. Which keyword is used for pass by reference in C#?
- ref - ans
- out
- in
- val

3. What is the main difference between 'ref' and 'out' parameters in C#?
- 'out' parameters must be initialized before passing to the method
- 'ref' parameters must be initialized before passing to the method - ans
- 'out' is used for input-only parameters, while 'ref' is used for output-only parameters
- There is no difference between 'ref' and 'out'

4. In which of the following scenarios is the 'out' keyword commonly used?
- When a method returns multiple values
- When a method modifies the value of the parameter - ans
- When a method requires an initialized variable to be passed
- When a method accepts an array as a parameter

5. Which combination of keywords allows a method to both accept a variable number of arguments and modify their values?
- ref and params - ans
- out and params
- ref and out
- None of the above

6. In C#, can a method have both 'ref' and 'out' parameters?
- Yes - ans
- No
- Only if the method is static
- Only if the method is part of an interface

7. What is the difference between pass by value and pass by reference?
- Pass by value creates a copy of the variable, while pass by reference passes the reference of the variable.
- Pass by value is faster than pass by reference.
- Pass by reference can be used to modify the original variable, while pass by value cannot.
- All of the above.
