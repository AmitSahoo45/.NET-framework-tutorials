# Structs

Very similar to classes
Only Difference is we use the struct keyword to create structs.

```cs
public struct Rgbcolor{
    public int red;
    public int green;
    public int blue;
}
```

Use a struct when you when you want to create a lightweight object like the above one. 
Or that you want to create a point that has X and Y coordinates, then this is suitable. 
But if you are in a situation where you have to create tens and thousands of classes then you can ggo for this. 
At the same time there si no problem in using classes.
