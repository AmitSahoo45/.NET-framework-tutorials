1. What is the difference between arrays and lists?
- [] - Arrays are limited and primitive types, but we can store any types in lists.
- [] - Arrays are faster than lists.
- [] - There is no differene. Both can be used to store a sequence of objects.
- [x] - Arrays are fixed in size, Lists are dynamic in size. More items can be added faster. 

2. What is be the output for this code?
```cs
var nums = new List<int>(1,2,3,4,5);
var index = numbers.indexOf(1);
```
- [x] - 0
- [] - 1
- [] - 2
- [] - 3


3. How can you access the last element of a list? (imp)
- [] - List.Last
- [] - List.LastIndexOf()
- [] - List[list.count - 1]
- [] - List[list.count]
