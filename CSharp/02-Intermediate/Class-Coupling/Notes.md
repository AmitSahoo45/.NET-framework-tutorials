# Class Coupling

Coupling is a way that tells us how interconnected classes are.

An app whose classes are tightly coupled is difficult to test.
Tightly coupled means that the classes is dependent on another classes.
There is a chance we might break things.

A loosely coupled app can be built using 
- Encapsulation
- The relationship between classes
- Interfaces

### Types of relationships
- Inheritance
- Composition
- Favour of composition over inheritance
