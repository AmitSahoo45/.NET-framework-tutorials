## Generics, Delegates and Collections. 

1. What is the difference between a generic class and a non-generic class?
- [] - A generic class can be used with different data types, while a non-generic class can only be used with a specific data type
- [x] - A generic class has a type parameter, while a non-generic class does not
- [] - A generic class can be inherited from, while a non-generic class cannot
- [] - All of the above

2. What is the syntax for declaring a generic class in C#?
- [x] - public class ClassName<T> { }
- [] - public class ClassName<T> : IComparable<T> { }
- [] - public class ClassName<T, U> { }
- [] - None of the above

3. What is the purpose of the where clause in C# generics?
- [x] - It specifies the constraints on the type parameter(s)
- [] - It specifies the type of the generic class
- [] - It specifies the type of the generic method
- [] - None of the above

4. What is the difference between a delegate and an anonymous method in C#?
- [x] - A delegate is a type, while an anonymous method is an expression
- [] - A delegate can be invoked multiple times, while an anonymous method can only be invoked once
- [] - A delegate can be passed as an argument to another method, while an anonymous method cannot
- [] - All of the above

5. 1. How can you create a generic method?
- [] - By using the `where` keyword
- [] - By using the `<>` syntax
- [] - By using the `T` keyword
- [x] - Both a and b

6. What is the syntax for declaring a delegate?
- [x] - `delegate return_type delegate_name(parameters);`
- [] - `delegate delegate_name(parameters);`
- [] - `delegate return_type delegate_name();`
- [] - `delegate delegate_name;`

7. How can you create a custom collection class?
- [] - By implementing the `IEnumerable` interface
- [] - By implementing the `ICollection` interface
- [] - By implementing the `IList` interface
- [x] - By implementing the `ICollection<T>` interface

8. 
```cs
public class MyDictionary<TKey, TValue> where TKey : struct
{
    // Implementation details
}
```

What does the where TKey : struct constraint indicate in the above code?

- [x] - It restricts TKey to only accept value types.
- [] - It allows TKey to be any data type.
- [] - It requires TKey to be a reference type.

9.

```cs
public delegate T Transformer<T>(T value);
public static T Square<T>(T input) => (dynamic)input * (dynamic)input;
```

What is the purpose of the Transformer delegate and the Square method?

- [] - The delegate represents a square operation, and the method performs the square of a value.
- [x] - The delegate represents any transformation operation, and the method squares the input.
- [] - The delegate and method have no relation.


10. 
```cs
Dictionary<string, int> myDictionary = new Dictionary<string, int>
{
    { "One", 1 },
    { "Two", 2 },
    { "Three", 3 }
};

myDictionary.Remove("Two");
```

What will be the count of elements in myDictionary after executing the above code?
- [x] - 2
- [] - 3
- [] - 1

11. 
```cs
List<string> colors = new List<string> { "Red", "Green", "Blue" };
Console.WriteLine(colors[3]);
```

What will happen when the above code is executed?

- [] - It will compile successfully and print "null".
- [x] - It will compile successfully but throw an exception at runtime.
- [] - It will not compile due to an index out of range error.

12. 
```cs
public static T FindMax<T>(T[] array) where T : IComparable<T>
{
    T max = array[0];
    foreach (T item in array)
    {
        if (item.CompareTo(max) > 0)
        {
            max = item;
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

What is the significance of the 'where T : IComparable<T>' constraint in the 'FindMax' method?
- [] - It allows the method to find the maximum value of any data type.
- [] - It restricts the method to only work with numeric data types.
- [x] - It ensures that the data type used must implement the 'IComparable<T>' interface.
- [] - It allows the method to work with any data type without constraints.
