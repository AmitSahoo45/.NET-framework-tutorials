### 1. What is Type Safety.
Type safety in programming refers to the ability of a programming language to prevent type errors. A type error occurs when an operation or function is performed on a data type that it does not support.

For example, in a statically typed language like C#, if you try to add a string to an integer, you will get a compile-time error because the addition operator (+) is not defined for these types. This is an example of type safety.

Type safety is important because it helps catch errors early in the development process, before the code is run. It makes the code easier to read and maintain, and it reduces the likelihood of bugs and security vulnerabilities.
