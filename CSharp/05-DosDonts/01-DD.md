### 1. Dont declare multiple variables in a single line
This is not valid. This will give compile time error.
```csharp
var heart = new Card { CardName = "Heart" }, diamond = new Card { CardName = "Diamond" }, club = new Card { CardName = "Club" }, spade = new Card { CardName = "Spade" };
```

This is valid. This will create 4 objects of Card class.
```csharp
var heart = new Card { CardName = "Heart" };
var diamond = new Card { CardName = "Diamond" };
var club = new Card { CardName = "Club" };
var spade = new Card { CardName = "Spade" };
```

### 2. Internal Classes in C# (VV Imp)
- Internal classes are accessible only within the same assembly, this means that if you have a class that is marked as internal, you can only access it from another class if both classes are in the same assembly.		
Assemblies are the .dll files that are created when you build your project. If you have a class library project, the assembly is the .dll file that is created when you build the project. If you have a web application project, the assembly is the .dll file that is created when you build the project.

### 4. Static Classes in C# (VV Imp)


### 5. Sealed Classes in C# (VV Imp)


### 6. Partial Classes in C# (VV Imp)


### 7. Abstract Classes in C# (VV Imp)

### 10. What will be return type if yield return?

```csharp
        public string displayCards()
        {
            foreach(var card in Cards)
                yield return card.CardName;
        }
```

This will throw error. Because return type of displayCards() is string but we are returning IEnumerable<string> from it. So, return type of displayCards() should be IEnumerable<string>.

The yield return keyword is used in C# to create an iterator. An iterator is a way to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly instead of generating them all at once. It's a way to create objects that can be iterated over, like collections or lists.

However, yield return can only be used inside an iterator block, which is a method, get-accessor, or operator that has an IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T> return type and contains one or more yield return statements.

the method displayCards() is declared to return a string, not an IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T>. This means you cannot use yield return inside this method.

If you want to return an IEnumerable of cards, you should change the return type of displayCards() to IEnumerable<string> or IEnumerable<T> (where T is the type of string).

```csharp
        public IEnumerable<T> displayCards()
        {
            foreach(var card in Cards)
                yield return card.CardName;
        }
```

This is an invalid way because you're using a generic type parameter T in your method signature without specifying its type.
The error message "could not resolve symbol T" is telling you that the compiler doesn't know what type T represents, and thus it cannot determine what type to use for card.CardName.

You should specify the type of T in your method signature, like this:

```csharp
		public IEnumerable<string> displayCards()
		{
			foreach(var card in Cards)
				yield return card.CardName;
		}
```

or 

```csharp
public IEnumerable<string> displayCards<T>()
{
    foreach (var card in Cards)
    {
        yield return card.CardName;
    }
}   
```

### 12. Why different outputs??
```csharp
      bool boolval = new bool();
      bool? val1 = new bool();
      bool? val2 = new bool?();
      bool val3 = new bool?();

        // display the values
        Console.WriteLine("Nullables at Show: {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}", num1, num2, num3, num4);
        Console.WriteLine("A boolean value\n", boolval, val1, val2);
```

This will throw compile time error. Because bool? is a nullable type and it can be assigned null. But bool is not a nullable type. So, you can't assign null to bool.

bool <- null ❌ 
bool? <- null ✅
bool <- bool? ✅
bool? <- bool? ✅

```csharp
        bool boolval = new bool();
        bool? val1 = new bool();
        bool? val2 = new bool?();
        // bool val4 = new bool?(); -> Error: Cannot implicitly convert type 'bool?' to 'bool'.Compile time error.

        Console.WriteLine(val1); // False
        Console.WriteLine(val2); // null
        Console.WriteLine(boolval); // False
```

### 13. Difference between two prints

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Subtraction " + d1.GetInvocationList()[0].DynamicInvoke(100, 20)); // "Subtraction: 80"
Console.WriteLine("Subtraction ", d1.GetInvocationList()[0].DynamicInvoke(100, 20)); // "Subtraction:"
```

a.   In this line, you're using string concatenation with the + operator to concatenate the string "Subtraction " and the result of d1.GetInvocationList()[0].DynamicInvoke(100, 20). Here, both parts are combined into a single string, and then the entire string is passed as an argument to Console.WriteLine(). As a result, both the string "Subtraction " and the result of the subtraction operation are included in the output.
  
b. In this line, you're using a comma to separate the string "Subtraction " and the result of d1.GetInvocationList()[0].DynamicInvoke(100, 20). However, when using a comma with Console.WriteLine(), the method treats each argument separately. The first argument "Subtraction " is printed, but the result of d1.GetInvocationList()[0].DynamicInvoke(100, 20) is not included in the output.


-> Potential Questions on delegates 
1.
    - add and delete events 
    - and then perform something, like add and remove the events.
    - and then ask the user to detect the output of the delegate.

2. 
    - show compile error when doing delagate exec = new delegate();
